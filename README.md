## Step1 - Using Codeblocks.

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, share** code.
A good _Cloud Engineer_ uses Codebloks whenever possible.

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues


- In order to create codeblocks in markdown you need to use three backticks (`).
- Not to be confused with quotation (')
```
def factorial(n)
  if n <= 1
    return 1
  else
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
  end
end

# Test the factorial function
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
puts "The factorial of #{number} is #{result}"

```

- When you can you shoul attempt  to apply syntax highlighting to you codeblocks

```ruby
def factorial(n)
  if n <= 1
    return 1
  else
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
  end
end

# Test the factorial function
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
puts "The factorial of #{number} is #{result}"

```
- Make note of where the bakctick button is located.
- It should appear above the tab key, but it may vary based on your keyboard type

Good Cloud Engineers use codeblock for both code and errors that appear in the console.
```bash
An error occurred: divided by 0
Backtrace:
example.rb:2:in `/'
example.rb:2:in `divide'
example.rb:8:in `<main>'
```

> Here is an example of using a codeblock for an error that apears in bash.

## Step 3 - Use Github Flavoured Task Lists

Github extends markdown to have a list where you can check off items. [<sup>[1]</sup>](#references)

# Step 4 - Use Emojis (Optional)

Github Flavored Markdown (GFM) supports emoji shortcodes.
Here are some examples:

| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud | `:cloud:` | :cloud: |
| Cloud with lighting | `:cloud_with_lightning:` | üå©Ô∏è |

# Step 5 - how to create a table

You can use the following markdown format to create tables:

```md
| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud | `:cloud:` | :cloud: |
| Cloud with lighting | `:cloud_with_lightning:` | üå©Ô∏è |
```
Github extends the functionality of Markdown tables to provide more alignment and table cell formatting options. [<sup>[2]</sup>](#references)
